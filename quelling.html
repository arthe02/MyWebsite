		<h3>Supplies</h3>
		<p>
			Paper: <br> To learn the basic shapes you will need many scrap
			strips of quilling paper to practice with. How many and in what
			lengths is entirely up to you. <br> A slotted or needle quilling
			tool.<br> Glue:<br>A quick drying tacky variety is best. <br>Patience:
			<br> Quilling is an incredibly rewarding and pleasurable craft
			once you get the hang of it, so hang in there and keep on trying!<br>

		<h3>Different shapes</h3>
		<p>
			Tight Rolled Coil:<br> Insert the tip of your paper strip into
			the slot of your quilling tool (or wrap around the quilling needle)
			and wind tightly. Secure with glue before sliding the coil off.<br>
		</p>

				<td><img src="Quilling/q3.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h3>Open Coil</h3>
		<p>
			Begin as you did with the closed coil. Slide the unglued coil from
			the tool and allow to gently open into circle shape. Glue end to
			secure. The open coil is the base shape for all the other shapes in
			this tutorial.You may wish to make a bunch and then further practice
			the remaining quilling shapes. <img src="Quilling/q4.jpg">

		<h3>Marquis</h3>
