	<p>Welcome to the world of terracotta!</p>
	<p>The terracotta clay can be bought from a local shop. The making
		process includes the following steps:
	<ol>
		<li>Preparation of clay:<br>
			<p>
				Preparation of clay is the initial step in making terracotta
				jewelry. Filtration of clay is often recommended to get pure clay
				free from dust and other particles. This you can do it by mixing
				clay with water. Add lot of water and just make a clay solution. The
				clay particles would settle down at the bottom after some time.
				Drain out the water from the top. It would help to wash off waste
				particles from clay. Repeat this few times until you get fine clay.
				Hope you know what is the ideal stage to make a jewelry. Just allow
				it to dry until it is flexible to mold. Next keep the clay on a flat
				surface and roll it out to remove the air inside. If you have air
				caught inside clay, there are chances to break the jewelry while
				baking. I just made few shapes out of clay. This is my first trial
				with clay. I was little tensed thinking of the outcome. To my
				surprise, I could make some pendants and Jumkas. <img

		<li>Terracotta Clay Jewelry Baking Process:<br>
			<p>There are several methods to bake terracotta clay. You may
				give your jewelry to a kiln to fire. When terracotta is fired, it
				turn red in color. But when you heat it under anaerobic conditions,
				the jewelry turn black in color. As I do not have an oven at home, i
				thought of baking it from home. It was my grandmother who told I can
				bake clay using saw dust. This was actually a thrilling experiment
				and I was eagerly waiting to see the outcome. I just took an iron
				pan and kept it on fire. In order to bake the clay, you need to buy
				some saw dust (wood dust). This you will get easily from any saw
				mill and is very cheap. When the pan is hot, just put some saw dust
				and keep the jewelry items above it. Then put some more saw dust
				over it.</p>
